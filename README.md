# My Qt QML Application

## Project Overview
This project is a Qt Quick application that integrates with Python using a custom Python bridge. It provides a modern UI with a material design style and allows interaction with Python code from QML. The application can serve various purposes, such as a desktop tool or a prototyping environment.

## Installation
To build and run this application, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Qt**: Make sure you have the Qt development environment set up. You can download it from the [official Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download).
2. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step-by-step Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred Qt IDE.

3. Configure the build settings according to your environment.

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   qmake
   make
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./[your-executable-name]
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you will be presented with the main window built using QML. The Python bridge is accessible in QML, allowing you to call Python functions and manage data flow between the QML interface and Python backend.

### Example Usage
You can interact with the application features as designed in the QML files. Refer to the QML code documentation for specific functions and properties exposed through the `pythonBridge` context property.

## Features
- User-friendly interface with material design for a modern look and feel.
- Integration with Python for dynamic backend support.
- Easy to extend with new QML components or Python functions.
- Cross-platform compatibility with any OS supporting Qt.

## Dependencies
Although the explicit dependencies for this project were not provided in a `package.json`, the application primarily relies on:
- **Qt** libraries for handling the GUI interface.
- **Python** for scripting capabilities.

Make sure you have the required development packages for your specific platform to ensure a smooth compilation process.
